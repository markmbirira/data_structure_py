"""
The selection sort algorithm sorts a list by finding the smallest element
and swapping it with the elements in position zero of the list. It then finds
the next smallest element and swaps it with the smallest in position one of 
the list.
This process continues until we have found the n - th smallest element and put
it in position n - 2. At this point, the largest element is in position n - 1.
Implement this algorithm in Python and indicate what its Theta classification.
Also time your code for the three lists described in the prevsious question.
